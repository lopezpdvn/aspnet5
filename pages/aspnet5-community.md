Not only this new version continues to have all source code available, but the
methodology adopted by the development team allows and encourages interaction
with the community. Reporting issues, submitting feature requests and other
community interactions happen at below locations:

* The [ASP.NET Home repository](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) is the starting
  point for people to learn about ASP.NET 5. The repo issue tracker should be
  used for general feedback and discussions.

* Each particular ASP.NET library and program has its own Github repository.
  Particular issue reports and feature requests should be submitted in the
  respective repository. See all the repositores at the [ASP.NET project Github
  profile](https://github.com/aspnet/).

* The [ASP.NET 5 forum](http://forums.asp.net/1255.aspx/1?ASP+NET+vNext) at the
  [ASP.NET forums site](http://forums.asp.net/).

* [StackOverflow][]. Search with the tags: [asp.net-5][], [asp.net-mvc-6][] and
  [entity-framework-7][].

* [JabbR chat room][] for real-time discussions.

Additionally, every Tuesday Microsoft team engages in real time with the
community in the [ASP.NET Community Standup][] at [Scott Hanselman's YouTube
Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/shanselman). In these weekly sessions the
Microsoft team reports recent development and design decisions and also answers
questions submitted on Google Hangout and on Twitter. The Community Standup
website is itself an ASP.NET 5 web application hosted in the cloud.

Past sessions are archived in a YouTube [playlist][].
