## Stages and activities

Except for stage [Be social about project](#be-social-about-project), all
stages are listed in chronologically order. Project ends at stage of
conclusion.

### Understanding main and related concepts

* The core concepts related to the design and purpose of ASP.NET will be
  reviewed.

* Study the history of ASP.NET.

* Study the historial relationship of ASP.NET with other major projects within
  the .NET ecosystem.

### Set development environment

Since ASP.NET 5 is cross platform, the available platforms for development are
Windows, Linux and OS X.

* ASP.NET on Linux and OS X requires Mono, and as of now in order to use the
  bleeding edge versions one needs to build Mono from source.  Because of this
  a development environment will be set up on a [Docker
  container](https://www.docker.com/) container and a docker file will be
  provided.

* Equivalent versions of the development environment on Windows will be shown.

* Getting to know the development workflow and tools.

* Set up credentials for communities across the web:
  [Jabbr.NET](https://jabbr.net/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  and the [ASP.NET forums](http://forums.asp.net/).

### Understand architectural concepts

* Achieve a deeper understanding of the relationship between ASP.NET and other
  important projects within the .NET and Web communities, specially those that
  are currently in development.

* Understand the relatioship between the ASP.NET and other recent projects such
  as Roslyn, ASP.NET MVC 6 and .NET 5.

* Be able to describe high level designs of solutions for specific
  applications, by combining ASP.NET with other related technologies and their
  respective development versions. This means in other words being aware of the
  upcoming features of the future releases.

### Be social about project

This is a stage that can be reached at any point in time of the work in the
project. Once reached, should be maintained indefinitively.  The activities
involved are:

* setting up a public website to distribute documentation about the project.
  The website should be easy to maintain and built with modern technologies, as
  well as it should distribute insightful content that helps readers become
  advocates and/or collaborators of project ASP.NET. Additionally the website
  should support multiple devices including smartphones and tablets.

* Participate in discussions and talk about issues.

* being willing to publicy talk about ASP.NET and using opportunities to do so.
  The reader is encouraged to share and use my [contact
  information](http://lopezpedro.net) for all things related ASP.NET 5.  

* preparation of talks for both technical and non-technical audiences.

### Conclusion

The activities are:

* Community work done is judged adequate enough and adequate to be graded as
  the assigned academic project.  

* Personally, advocacy will certaintly continue, development may continue or
  not.
