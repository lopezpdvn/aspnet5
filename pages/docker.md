Docker is a software project that implements lightweight containers on top of
the Linux operating system. Docker containers are similar to virtual machines
in terms of isolation of packaged applications, but they are lighter and easier
to maintain and deploy.

Docker can be integrated into several cloud services providers such as
Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Jenkins and
Puppet. A lot of applications and development environments have been
*dockerized*, which means that a docker container with the respective
application or technology already installed and provided by official or third
party sources. A few examples of **official** containers:

- [Fedora base images](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/fedora/)

- [Images for Ruby programming language and
  environment](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/ruby/)

- [ASP.NET image containers by
  Microsoft](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/microsoft/aspnet/)
